Shucker
=======
[![Crates.io Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/shucker?link=https%3A%2F%2Fcrates.io%2Fcrates%2Fshucker)](https://crates.io/crates/shucker) [![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/shucker)](https://pypi.org/project/shucker/)

Shucker is a tracking-param filtering library, designed to strip URLs down to their canonical forms. It contains internally a set of rules derived from the [AdguardFilters](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters) TrackParamFilter set, and then stripped down be able to be runnable outside of a browser. Note that although the original filters were designed for Javascript-based browser extensions, Shucker's core is a pure-Rust implementation for raw speed (some testing done against Hyperfine, but certainly seems fast enough so far i.e. < 1ms).

There is an [example command line tool provided](src/bin/shuck.rs) (`cargo run --bin shuck <list of urls>`) but the main usage will either be via the `shucker::shuck` fn, or the Python `shucker` library with `shucker.shuck` (which is mostly a thin wrapper over the Rust code), both of which take a URL and return a version of it without the ad-tracking.

Rebuilding the rules set
------------------------
`make rebuild_rules` will pull the latest upstream rules and rebuild.

Licensing
---------
The actual core Shucker code (i.e. everything _except_ the `external/adguardfilters` folder) is licensed under the [LGPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html). However, the `external/adguardfilters` code is [GPL v3](external/adguardfilters/LICENSE) and as that is used as part of the build-time generation of Shucker currently, the overall library is therefore GPLv3. This might change in the future if we remove said build-time requirement though.
